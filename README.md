# My Celo DApp
## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) is built on the Celo blockchain and allows users to interact with smart contracts directly from a web interface. The DApp is developed using Solidity for smart contracts and HTML/Javascript for the front end. It demonstrates how to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on Celo while providing a user-friendly web interface.
Features

    Smart Contract Integration: The DApp interacts with a deployed smart contract on the Celo blockchain.
    Blockchain Interaction: Users can send and receive transactions on the Celo network.
    Web3.js: The app uses Web3.js to communicate between the blockchain and the frontend.
    Celo Wallet Integration: Connects with Celo wallets for seamless interaction.

## Technologies Used

    Celo: Blockchain platform for the deployment of the DApp.
    Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
    HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web app.
    Javascript (Web3.js): For interacting with the Celo blockchain.
    Remix IDE: Used for writing and deploying the smart contract.

## Installation

To run this DApp locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/celo-dapp.git
cd celo-dapp
```

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:

```bash

npm install
```

## Set Up Celo Wallet:

    Install the Celo CLI:

    bash

    npm install -g @celo/celocli

    Create and fund a Celo wallet using testnet tokens by following Celo’s Wallet Setup Guide.

## Deploy the Smart Contract:

    Use Remix IDE to deploy the contract to the Celo testnet. The contract code can be found in the smart_contracts/ folder.
    After deployment, note the contract address and replace it in your config.js file.

## Run the DApp: Start the local server to host the frontend:

```bash

    npm start
```

    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the DApp.

Smart Contract Details

The smart contract is written in Solidity and includes the following functionalities:

    Contract Functions:
        functionName1: Description of what the function does.
        functionName2: Description of what the function does.
    The smart contract is deployed on the Celo testnet at address 0xYourSmartContractAddress.

Usage

    Connect Celo Wallet: Users need to connect their Celo wallet (e.g., Valora or MetaMask configured for Celo) to interact with the DApp.

    Interact with the Contract:
        Execute smart contract functions via the web interface.
        View real-time data on the blockchain.

## Configuration

In the config.js file, update the contract address and network ID to point to your deployed contract on the Celo testnet.

javascript

const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourSmartContractAddress";
const CELO_NETWORK_ID = "44787"; // Celo Alfajores Testnet
